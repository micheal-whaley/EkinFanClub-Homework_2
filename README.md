Create a Student Manager first. Then you will need to use the readFromFile() method with a txt file that has the student information in it.
This will scan the information and format it into Student class objects. It will return true if it was successfully read and false if not. You can also use the Student Manager's class displayStudents() method which will print out all students information including their student id, name and grade by going through all students in the Student Manager array. Next you can use the searchStudentById() function which takes the parameter of an id. It will go through the students under that student manager and return the information of that student. Next we have updateStudentGradeById() which takes a first parameter of the student's id and then a second of the student's new grade. It will find the student and then update that grade.

We have checks in all of our code that returns false for boolean methods if the parameters are invalid or it is unable to retrieve data. It returns true otherwise. As far as dependencies go everything needed to import is displayed in the files/classes.
